**Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) Meeting Summary - Pre-MDT and Post-MDT Comparison**

**Patient Information (Summary):**
- **Name**: Mrs. Margaret Johnson, 74 years old
- **Diagnosis**: Lynch syndrome (MLH1 mutation)
- **Comorbidities**: Type 2 Diabetes, Hypertension, Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage 3), Osteoarthritis
- **Past Medical History**: Colorectal cancer (resected 8 years ago), total hysterectomy (due to endometrial cancer 10 years ago), ongoing management of diabetes and hypertension

### **Pre-MDT Review (AI-Generated Potential Discussion Points)**

**Presenting Concerns:**
Mrs. Johnson presents with gastrointestinal symptoms, including intermittent rectal bleeding and abdominal discomfort, which could indicate recurrence or a new malignancy, given her Lynch syndrome and history of colorectal cancer. Additionally, her osteoarthritis has led to reduced mobility, affecting her overall quality of life.

**Potential Key Discussion Points:**

1. **Surveillance and Screening**
   - **Colorectal Surveillance**: Consider recommending an urgent colonoscopy to evaluate the source of rectal bleeding and assess for recurrence of colorectal cancer.
   - **Upper GI Screening**: Given the abdominal discomfort, an upper endoscopy could be proposed to rule out other GI malignancies associated with Lynch syndrome.
   - **Frequency of Surveillance**: Discuss whether reducing the frequency of invasive procedures might be appropriate, depending on findings and patient tolerance, especially considering her comorbidities and advanced age.

2. **Management of Comorbidities**
   - **Diabetes and Hypertension**: Optimize glycemic and blood pressure control to reduce procedural risks. Consider involving an endocrinologist to review her current management plan.
   - **Chronic Kidney Disease**: Recommend a nephrology consultation to assess kidney function, especially if any procedure may involve contrast.
   - **Osteoarthritis**: Explore options for pain management, including physiotherapy and possible referral to a pain specialist to improve mobility and quality of life.

3. **Genetic Counseling and Family Considerations**
   - Given her Lynch syndrome, suggest genetic counseling for her children and grandchildren to assess their cancer risk and recommend appropriate genetic testing.

4. **Psychosocial Support**
   - Address her anxiety related to her health and potential new cancers. Consider a referral to a counselor with experience in cancer-related anxiety, as well as connecting her with Lynch syndrome support groups.

5. **Lifestyle and Risk Reduction**
   - Recommend dietary changes to help manage both her diabetes and cancer risk, such as a high-fiber, low-sugar diet. Encourage gentle physical activities as tolerated.
   - Evaluate the potential use of aspirin as a chemopreventive agent for colorectal cancer, while weighing the risks of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### **Post-MDT Review Summary**

**Key Discussion Points:**

1. **Surveillance and Screening**
   - **Colorectal Surveillance**: Given Mrs. Johnson's history of colorectal cancer and Lynch syndrome, it was recommended to conduct a colonoscopy as soon as possible to evaluate the source of rectal bleeding.
   - **Upper GI Screening**: Given the recent abdominal discomfort, an upper endoscopy was also recommended to rule out any gastric malignancy, considering Lynch syndrome can elevate risks for other gastrointestinal cancers.
   - **Frequency**: Given her advanced age and multiple comorbidities, the team discussed modifying the frequency of inv
